            <h2>Toys, the magical reaction that toys create and the world of imagination that toys promote, 
            are at the center of all that we do. We are trusted that our toys work as expected, 
            are safe for use and will bring enjoyment to children all year round, year after year. 
            It sounds easy but in reality we put a lot of thought and hard work into getting it right.</h2>
